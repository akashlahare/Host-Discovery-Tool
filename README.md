# 🛰️ Host Discovery Tool
A Python-based multithreaded ping scanner that scans a range of IP addresses using ICMP echo requests. It identifies reachable hosts, displays their response times, and allows custom IP range input for flexible network discovery.

# Multithreaded Ping Scanner Tool
A Python tool that scans a range of IP addresses by sending ICMP echo requests. It uses multithreading for faster scanning, allows custom IP ranges, and displays response times for reachable hosts.

# 🚀 Key Features
## Multithreading – Speeds up scanning by pinging multiple hosts in parallel.
## Custom IP Range – Input any start and end IPv4 addresses to define the scan range.
## Response Time Display – Shows the time taken to respond for each reachable host.
## Cross-platform Compatible – Works on both Windows and Linux.
